# My 42 Journey Is Now a GitHub Organization

I've created a dedicated GitHub organization for my full 42 experience:  
- **[42-joaorodrigues](https://github.com/42-joaorodrigues)**

Inside, you'll find:

- **One repo per project** — clean, well-documented, and easy to explore
- **Organized lists** — grouped by Piscine, Common Core, C++, and more
- **A downloadable version** — clone everything at once with submodules:  
[42-downloadable](https://github.com/ghjoaorodrigues/42-downloadable)

Whether you're a peer, recruiter, or just curious — it's all structured and ready to browse.
