# 42 Curriculum Journey

This repository is a structured overview of my journey through the [42 Network](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) — an intensive, project-based programming school with no teachers, no lectures, and no tuition.

Below you'll find each major phase of the program, organized as Git submodules. Each directory includes a detailed README listing the individual projects completed in that phase.
